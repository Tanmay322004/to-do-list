##  About

**Designed and implemented by:** Tanmay Agrawal

This project demonstrates the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in a small JavaScript app. It manages tasks with features such as adding, completing, and removing to-dos. The state is handled in the model, the UI is rendered by the view, and user interactions are managed through the controller.

---

##  Features

- **Add tasks** by typing in the input field and pressing Enter or clicking "Add"
- **Toggle completion** by clicking on a task
- **Remove tasks** individually or clear all completed tasks
- **Modular structure** using separate model, view, and controller logic in `script.js`
- **Styled UI** using simple and responsive CSS in `style.css`
